# Brand

This is the **front door** for any brand work, and it has two jobs:

1. **Understand what exists, diagnose how much should change, and route.** The depth of the work — a ground-up build, a refresh, or just better execution — is *your* diagnosis to make from the evidence. The user does not need to know the framework behind it.
2. **Own the record.** Get-or-make **`.agents/brand.md`** — the single source of truth for the brand's visual identity that every other design skill reads first, so the user never re-explains their colors, type, muses, or latitude.

> `brand` always runs. `brand-strategy` is the deep generative path it *routes to* — and when the brand is already sound, it routes away from strategy entirely. That's why they're separate skills: one runs without the other.

## Step 1: Gather the Assets — Do the Legwork Yourself

Start here, always — and **take this off the user's plate.** Don't hand them a homework assignment ("send me your logo files, your colors, your social links, your decks…"). Get the one thing you actually need to begin — **the website URL** (or, failing that, the company name) — and go find the rest yourself.

**From just the domain, gather autonomously:**
- **Crawl the key pages**, not only the homepage — home, product/features, pricing, about, blog. Each surface uses the brand differently.
- **Extract real values from the rendered pages** — computed colors, `font-family` names, type scale, spacing, button/CTA treatment, radii, shadows.
- **Capture the logo — and make sure it's the *current* one.** The source of truth for the live mark is the **navigation bar / header of the rendered site**, nothing else. Inspect the actual `<header>`/`<nav>` and pull the exact asset it uses — the `<img src>`, the inline `<svg>`, or the CSS `background-image`. A plain text/markdown fetch strips this out, so read the raw HTML/DOM or screenshot the nav and confirm what you extracted matches what's on screen.
  - **Favicons, apple-touch-icons, manifest icons, OG images, social avatars, and press-kit downloads are frequently outdated** — teams refresh the nav logo and forget the rest. Treat them as *secondary*: useful for collecting the other implementations (small, square, reversed), but **reconcile every one against the nav logo**. If they disagree, the live nav wins as "current," and the mismatch is itself a finding (stale assets to fix).
  - You still want the full set — a mark's *simplicity* is judged by whether it's the **same** mark across all of them — but the **nav logo is the reference**, not the favicon. Don't let an old favicon or a stale press kit stand in for the current identity.
- **Follow the footer.** Almost every site links its own social profiles, app-store listings, and sometimes a press or brand page down there. Harvest those links and follow them.
- **Check the common brand/press paths** — `/brand`, `/brand-assets`, `/press`, `/media-kit`, `/about/brand`. Companies routinely publish logos, palettes, and usage rules there.
- **Screenshot and actually *look* at the rendered design — don't score from tokens alone.** A brand's identity often lives in things a CSS/token dump or a product-UI Figma never expose: a recurring **graphic motif** (a radial, shape, or texture repeating across the hero, sections, and social), the **accent colors** used only in the hero or social art, and the **logo's symbol/glyph**. Examine the hero, feature graphics, and social posts directly. Never conclude "no pattern" or "wordmark-only, no mark" from tokens — confirm with your eyes. These feed Pattern & Texture, Color, and Logo, and missing them is how a strong brand gets mis-scored as weak.
- **Read the codebase if you're in it.** A site repo's CSS / Tailwind config / design-token files are the most precise source there is — prefer them over anything inferred from a screenshot.
- **Pull Figma** if a link or connected file is available.
- **Source the competitor set from the marketing context — don't freelance it.** Identifying competitors by gut is hit-or-miss; pull the authoritative set instead, in this order:
  1. **`.agents/product-marketing.md`** (from the marketing-skills library) — if it exists, use its **Competitive Landscape**: direct / secondary / indirect competitors, with why each falls short. The audit scores distinctiveness against the **direct** set; secondary/indirect inform the landscape but aren't the visual peer group.
  2. **The `competitor-profiling` skill** — if there's no marketing context, run it (`/competitor-profiling`) to research and profile competitors properly, rather than guessing.
  3. **Autonomous discovery** — fallback only: infer the direct competitors from the category, the positioning, and the brand's own comparison/alternative pages.

  Then capture each direct competitor's identity across the nine audit categories — the comparison set the Step 2 audit scores against (see [references/brand-audit.md](references/brand-audit.md)) — and confirm the list with the user (below).

**Confirm the competitor set before any scoring.** Your idea of "direct competitors" is often wrong, and the entire distinctiveness verdict rides on it. Present the list you assembled — *"Here's who I'm treating as your direct competitors: … Anyone to add, remove, or swap?"* — and get the user's sign-off before running the Step 2 scorecard. Don't score against an unverified set.

**Then show the user what you found, and ask only for the gaps you genuinely can't reach yourself:**
- Private or internal material — a Figma you don't have access to, sales decks, print collateral, photography libraries not on the site
- The **why** behind decisions you can only see the *what* of
- Anything the Step 2 diagnosis hinges on that the assets don't answer

**Build the asset inventory** from all of it — what you gathered, what the user added, and what's still missing. Gaps are findings: they show where the brand is undefined, and how much exists is the first input to the diagnosis.

**As you ingest** (see [references/asset-intake.md](references/asset-intake.md)):
- Extract concrete values — hex codes, named typefaces, spacing, logo lockups, photo treatment — not impressions
- **Watch how the brand behaves across mediums.** The site may be buttoned-up while social runs loose — that contrast *is* data; it reveals what's truly **fixed** vs. what already **flexes**.
- **Stated ≠ practiced.** A style guide claims one thing; the live assets often show another. Capture both and flag the drift.

If little or nothing exists, that itself is the key finding — carry it into the diagnosis.

## Step 2: Diagnose How Much Should Change

**This is your diagnosis, not a question for the user — and you make it with a critical eye, not a generous one.** A client has no idea what "Revolution / Evolution / Optimization" mean — never ask them to pick or lead with the jargon. Read the situation from the assets in Step 1 plus a few plain questions, then conclude. These are *your* internal scoping labels:

**The verdict is a phased recommendation anchored to the client's appetite and timeline — not a single label derived from the scores.** Ask, plainly, how much they want to change *now* vs. later, and whether they want incremental polish or a transformational break; that appetite isn't visible in the assets and it's the *primary* driver. A brand can score low and still be **"Optimization now, deeper work later."** Diagnose honestly (competitor similarity + scores) to shape the *roadmap*, then recommend a path — often sequenced:

- **Optimization** — the immediate design-fundamentals work on the *existing* assets (typography, hierarchy, contrast, layout, palette rationalization, consistency). The right starting point for **any client moving incrementally — even a generic-foundation one** — with deeper work teed up for later; also the terminal answer when assets are strong and only execution lags (the strong-assets-badly-built case). *(Or the low-scoring, genuinely generic brand whose client wanted "optimization now, bigger later" → Optimization now, refine what exists, sequence creative-direction later.)*
- **Evolution** — keep the equity, do generative build-out (creative direction, motif, deploy missing pieces) — the equity-in-a-drawer case.
- **Revolution** — rebuild the foundation: colliding/undifferentiated with little to keep (the lookalike case), or the client wants a transformational break and has the appetite for it.

**Never override the client's incremental appetite with a diagnosis-driven verdict, and never argue against the depth they asked for.** Be honest about what each phase buys: Optimization-now makes a generic brand *tidier*, not *distinct* — distinctiveness comes from the creative-direction phase. Don't sell polish as distinctiveness; don't refuse polish because distinctiveness needs more. The common shape is **micro now (Optimization) → macro later (creative direction)**.

**Optimization vs Evolution:** in an Optimization you change only *how existing assets are implemented* (design fundamentals on what's there); in an Evolution you also *create, define, or deploy* pieces that are missing, unanchored, or sitting in a drawer.

At **moderate** similarity it's a genuine **fork the client chooses by appetite**: Optimization (content with the overlap → keep the assets, execute higher, shore the gaps) vs Revolution (want to break away → a wholesale shift, not incremental). Weigh their stated ambition; never assume it.

**Hold a high bar — coherent is not the same as good** (see `design-principles` → Coherent Is Not the Same as Good):

- Consistency, intentionality, and "not dated" are *table stakes*, not proof of a sound brand. A tidy brand is usually just *fine* — and "fine" is an **Evolution**, not an Optimization.
- **Test distinctiveness, not just coherence.** Look outward — scan the category, the direct competitors, and the prevailing design trend. A brand is only distinct *relative to them*. With the logo covered, would anyone know it was them?
- **Name the default.** A polished execution of the current category or AI-startup aesthetic — near-black canvas, high-contrast serif display, a single jewel-tone accent, parchment warmth, a tasteful mono — is *generic*, not sound. Reading as "deliberate" doesn't save it; everyone is deliberate in the same way. Flag the trend as a finding, not a strength.
- **Assess the logo specifically** with `logo-design` against the SAD bar — **Simple** (it must hold in plain black & white; if it leans on color or a gradient to read, that's a failure), **Appropriate** (to the emotional target), **Distinct** (against the competitor logos you gathered, not in isolation). A weak or generic mark is a real part of the diagnosis — don't wave it through because it's "their logo." And **the mark is always on the table**: if the creative direction is shifting significantly (Revolution or serious Evolution), the logo is in scope for change too — flag that rather than treating it as untouchable equity.
- **Lead with the critique — but separate diagnosis from recommendation.** Your value is catching "this is fine" dressed up as "this is good": a generic or competitor-colliding foundation is *not* a sound brand — don't declare it fundamentally fine. That's the honest *diagnosis* (the scores). It's separate from the *recommendation*, which is phased and appetite-anchored — you can diagnose a weak foundation *and* still recommend Optimization-now (fundamentals first), with the creative-direction work sequenced later. Don't confuse "the foundation is weak" (a scoring truth) with "so we must Revolutionize now" (a recommendation the client's appetite may not support).
- **Don't be fooled by rank or drift.** "We're #2 in the category" is not distinctiveness if the category is a lookalike cluster — best-in-cluster is still generic (this applies to the logo too: least-plain wordmark in a plain set ≠ distinct). And finding execution problems (stale press kit, half-finished font migration, fragmenting color) does *not* mean the foundation is *sound* — drift routinely sits on top of an undifferentiated foundation, so don't let it inflate the foundational *scores*. (It's fine for those execution fixes to become the Optimization-now *phase* of the roadmap — just don't mistake them for evidence the foundation is strong.)
- **Implementation flaws are not weak assets.** Look *through* a rough site. A distinctive pattern shown at blown-out contrast is a *strong asset, badly executed* — an Optimization signal — not a weak pattern; a great typeface buried in banded layouts is still a great typeface. Assess each asset's intrinsic quality and distinctiveness *separately* from how well the current site implements it. Slop-ish execution (banding, over-contrast, screenshot bleed) sitting on strong, distinct, *deployed* assets means fix the build (Optimization) — not a weak foundation.

**Run the brand audit — don't eyeball it.** Work through the nine categories ([references/brand-audit.md](references/brand-audit.md)) against the **confirmed** competitor set, with named comparisons (whose palette/mark/motif it resembles or collides with). Score on **two axes**: the foundational categories (Creative Direction, Color, Logo, Pattern) on *distinctiveness* against the field; the craft categories (Typography & Layout, Graphics, Icons, Application, Style Guide) on *execution quality* — where well-made, consistent work reaches 4–5 even with a common typeface or stock icons. **Creative Direction does NOT cap the craft scores.** Then read **competitor similarity** — the heaviest-weighted pivot — and let it plus the client's appetite drive the path (split fork at moderate similarity). Present the recommended path with rationale **and the alternative's tradeoff**. Write the audit into `.agents/brand.md`.

**Run the AI-slop check** ([../design-principles/references/ai-slop.md](../design-principles/references/ai-slop.md)) on the brand and the whole set. Tropes — a left accent rail, a purple-to-blue gradient, a cramped center container, no variety between section layouts, `rounded-lg` on everything — are findings that **cap a dimension's score**, however "clean" it looks. Name each one you find.

**Diagnose from plain signals** (ask only what the assets don't answer):
- Is the brand *wrong/off-strategy*, just *dated*, *coherent but generic*, or *genuinely strong and distinct but poorly applied*?
- Is it actually distinct in its category, or a tidy version of the current trend?
- What's real equity worth protecting, vs. what only *looks* finished?
- How much exists, and how good is it, honestly?
- **What's the appetite and timeline?** Do they want to change a lot now, or move incrementally — fundamentals now, bigger moves later? This drives the recommended path more than the scores do. *Ask it; don't infer it* — it isn't visible in the assets.

This also sets your **mode**: a genuinely strong brand → *ingest and protect the equity*; an okay-or-absent one → *raise or generate it through discovery*.

**Reflect your conclusion back in plain terms, honestly** — e.g., *"Your brand is coherent and clearly intentional, but right now it looks a lot like the rest of the AI-tools category — serif-on-black with a single green accent is everywhere this year. That's not a broken brand, but it's not a distinct one yet. So I'd treat this as an evolution: keep the name and the bones, push the look somewhere only you could own."* Don't flatter coherent-but-generic work into "sound." Use the REO word only if it helps; the honest read and the routing are what matter.

### Present the full assessment — don't skip to the verdict

**The per-category breakdown is the deliverable, not a byproduct.** Always present it in the response — never collapse the audit into a one-line verdict or only write it to a file. Show, in this order:

1. **The scorecard table** — all nine categories with their scores, a blank **"Your score"** column for the user, plus the **Competitor similarity** read and the **verdict + recommended path**.
2. **The per-category breakdown** — for each of the nine: the score, **Why it matters**, **Current status** (with named competitor comparisons), and **Moving forward**.
3. **The competitor set** used, the **name / verbal-identity** flag, and the **AI-slop** findings.
4. **The split paths** — the recommended depth with rationale *and* the alternative's tradeoff.

The one-line verdict is a header on top of this breakdown, never a replacement for it. Also save it as a standalone artifact (e.g. `<brand>-brand-audit-scorecard.md`) alongside `.agents/brand.md` so the user keeps a copy — but presenting it in full comes first.

## Step 3: Route by Depth

### Revolution → define it from scratch
There's little to capture. Send the user to **`brand-strategy`** for full discovery (vision, muses, emotional target, distinct concepts, and the fixed-core / flexible-range latitude), then **`creative-direction`** to build the visual system. `.agents/brand.md` starts mostly empty and fills as those skills produce answers. Stub it now so the structure is ready.

### Evolution → capture, then change only the deltas
1. **Capture what exists** (from the assets ingested in Step 1) into `.agents/brand.md` — the real current colors, type, assets, voice. Be accurate; this is the baseline.
2. **Separate what stays from what changes.** Make the equity explicit (this becomes much of the **Fixed core**), and name the specific things being refreshed.
3. Route to **`brand-strategy` *focused only on the deltas*** — don't re-run a full from-scratch discovery on a brand that already has equity. Then **`creative-direction`** evolves the system, carrying the fixed parts forward.

### Optimization → capture, audit, fix execution
1. **Capture what exists** (from the assets ingested in Step 1) into `.agents/brand.md` — accurately, as the constraint.
2. **Audit the execution against the sound identity** — where is the good brand being applied poorly? This is the gap.
3. Route **straight to the medium skills** (`web-design`, `collateral-design`, etc.) to fix and expand the application. Little or no new strategy — the brand is the answer, not the question. `brand-strategy` is usually skipped here.

Match effort to depth. Treating a sound brand as a rebuild throws away hard-won equity; treating a broken one as a polish job just refines a bad foundation.

## Step 4: Get or Make `.agents/brand.md`

The document lives at **`.agents/brand.md`**. Check first whether it exists (also `.claude/brand.md` or a legacy `brand-guidelines.md`; offer to move it if found elsewhere). If it exists, read it, summarize, and update only the sections in play.

Otherwise, **get it or make it**:
- **Get it** (a brand already exists) — derive the document directly from the assets you ingested in Step 1. The brand is already out there in the world; your job is to read it accurately and write it down.
- **Make it** (little exists) — the document is an *output* of `brand-strategy` and `creative-direction`. Stub it now and fill it as those skills produce answers.

Either way, draft from the asset inventory (plus `.agents/product-marketing.md` if present), then ask *"What's wrong, and what's missing?"* Prefer concrete specifics (a hex value, a named typeface, a real treatment) over adjectives.

Use the template in [references/brand-doc-template.md](references/brand-doc-template.md). Sections:

1. **Brand at a glance** — name, one-liner, category, and the depth you diagnosed in Step 2
2. **Emotional target** — the few feelings the brand must produce; the rubric everything is judged against
3. **Muses** — each with its *stealable visual cue*
4. **Audience** — who it must feel right *to* (link `.agents/product-marketing.md` rather than duplicating)
5. **Visual system** — color (by role, with ramps + action-color protection), typography (faces by role, weight/style rules), composition, pattern & texture, illustration, iconography, photography — established in `creative-direction`
6. **Logo** — lockups, clear space, minimum size, misuse
7. **Voice** — tone and personality (link `.agents/product-marketing.md` if present)
8. **Fixed core vs. flexible range** — what must **always** hold vs. where the brand is free to flex. In an Evolution this is partly *given* by the equity you're keeping. Without it, `design-critique` can't tell a legitimate flex from a drift.
9. **In use** — examples of correct application

## Step 5: Confirm and Save

Show the document, ask what needs adjusting, save to `.agents/brand.md`, and tell the user: *"Other design skills will use this automatically. Run `/brand` anytime to update it."*

## How Other Skills Use This

- `brand-strategy` writes **Emotional target**, **Muses**, **Fixed core vs. flexible range** (Revolution, and the deltas in Evolution)
- `creative-direction` writes the **Visual system**
- `logo-design` writes the **Logo** section
- The application skills (`web-design`, `collateral-design`, `email-design`, `social-design`, `motion-design`) *read* this and apply it
- `design-critique` *judges* against the **Emotional target** and the **Fixed-core / Flexible-range** latitude

## Tips

- **Diagnose, don't quiz.** The user describes their situation in plain words; *you* decide the depth and the path. Reflect it back, don't make them choose it.
- **Specifics, not adjectives.** "Confident" is not a spec; "Akzidenz-Grotesk Bold, all-caps, tight tracking, ink-black on bone" is.
- **Record the *why*.** "The action color is the one warm hue in a cool palette, so a button always reads as the one place to go" survives a redesign; a bare hex doesn't.
- **Capture before you change.** An accurate baseline is the whole game — you can't protect equity you haven't written down.
- **Keep it current.** This is a living document; update it whenever a project establishes something new.
